TEST: Any Parameters Seen
Description: Autopilots store configuration settings known as 'parameters'. For proper analysis, logs must contain this parameter information. This test will FAIL if the input does not contain parameter information.
* Pass: Parameters seen

TEST: Good EKF
Description: The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has many built-in checks to ensure that it is functioning correctly.  This test will FAIL or WARN if EKF variances exceed the respective thresholds, or FAIL if the EKF status flags indicate errors.
* Fail: The EKF status report indicates a problem with the EKF
* Fail: pos_horiz_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: compass_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: pos_vert_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: velocity_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Warn: compass_variance exceeds warn threshold
* Warn: pos_horiz_variance exceeds warn threshold
* Warn: velocity_variance exceeds warn threshold

TEST: Altitude Estimate Divergence
Description: A UAV often has several estimates of its Altitude.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's Altitude estimates diverge.
* Fail: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude
* Warn: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude

TEST: Ever Armed
Description: Vehicles typically need to progress through a sequence of arming steps before they can move.  This test will FAIL if the craft did not arm.
* Pass: The vehicle armed

TEST: Attitude Control
Description: The autopilot reports both the craft's attitude and the attitude the craft believes it should be at.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the vehicle's desired attitudes and achieved attitudes are not within threshold delta values for more than a threshold time.
* Fail: Desired attitude not achieved
* Warn: Desired attitude not achieved

TEST: Battery
Description: Many autopilots are capable of monitoring their flight batteries.  This test will FAIL if the battery level falls below the battery failsafe threshold level, or if a battery failsafe event is received.
* Pass: Battery never below failsafe

TEST: AutoPilot Health
Description: Many autopilots are capable of monitoring their own performance.  This test will FAIL if problems are detected with the autopilot.

TEST: GPS Fix
Description: The accuracy and precision of GPS messages can vary depending on many factors including weather, ionospheric disturbances and number of satellites visible.  This test will FAIL if the quality of the GPS information is poor.
* Fail: No 3D fix was ever acquired
* Pass: First 3D GPS Fix Acquired

TEST: Ever Flew
Description: Determining whether a vehicle has ever flown in a log is done heuristically based on things like motor speeds.  This test will FAIL if the craft did not ever seem to fly.
* Pass: The vehicle appeared to fly

TEST: Sensor Health
Description: A UAV can self-assess its sensors' health.  This test will FAIL if any sensor is detected as failed.
* Fail: The craft's assessment of its sensors indicate a problem

TEST: Crash Test
Description: Crashes are detected both heuristically and by explicit log messages.  This test will FAIL if the vehicle appears to crash.
* Fail: Vehicle is past maximum allowed angle and running its motors

TEST: Gyro Drift
Description: Gyroscopes sometimes start to register movement where there is none.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the any gyroscope's average acceleration on any axis begins to drift 

TEST: Vehicle Definition
Description: The vehicle type is normally automatically detected by dronekit-la from the log.  Sometimes the log does not contain sufficient information to make this determination.  This test will FAIL if the craft type is never defined
* Pass: Vehicle was appropriately defined

TEST: Brownout
Description: A log should not end while the vehicle appears to be moving under its own power.  This test will FAIL if the vehicle still appears to be moving when the log ends.
* Fail: Log ended while craft still flying

TEST: Position Estimate Divergence
Description: A UAV often has several estimates of its Position.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's Position estimates diverge.
* Fail: This position estimate differs from the canonical craft position

TEST: Compass Vector Length
Description: The strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field should be relatively constant and lie within certain thresholds.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the compass vector length exceeds the respective threshold.  Possible causes include flying near large metal objects.

TEST: Arming Checks
Description: An autopilot checks many aspects of the aircraft's state before allowing it to be armed - for example, that it has a good GPS fix.  This test will FAIL if the craft ever arms when some arming checks are disabled.

TEST: Velocity Estimate Divergence
Description: A UAV typically has several estimates of its velocity.  This test will FAIL if the craft's velocity estimates diverge.

TEST: Attitude Estimate Divergence
Description: A UAV often has several estimates of its Attitude.  This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's Attitude estimates diverge.
* Fail: This attitude estimate differs from the canonical craft attitude

TEST: Compass Offsets
Description: Compass calibration produces a set of parameters that specify expected compass discrepancies.  This test will WARN or FAIL depending on the degree that these compass offset parameters exceed specified thresholds.
* Fail: Compass offsets in parameters are out of bounds
