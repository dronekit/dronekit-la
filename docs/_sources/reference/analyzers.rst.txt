=============
Analyzer List
=============

This topic provides an overview of the available analyzers. These are all run by default
but you can specify to only run a subset using the ``-a`` argument (see 
:ref:`guide_selecting_analyzers`).

Each section lists a description of the analyzer, along with possible fails/warnings.

.. note::

    This section is provided for reference only. The log itself will include all this information
    along with the "severity" of the issue, "series" (where the error occurred) and "evidence" 
    (what caused a fail/warning to be raised).



Any Parameters Seen
=================== 

Autopilots store configuration settings known as 'parameters'. For proper analysis, logs must contain this parameter information. 
This test will FAIL if the input does not contain parameter information.

* Fail: No parameters present
* Pass: Parameters present


.. note::

    No user action can be taken in response to this error.

Altitude Estimate Divergence
============================

A UAV often has several estimates of its altitude.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's altitude estimates diverge.

* Fail: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude
* Warn: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude

Arming Checks
=============

An autopilot checks many aspects of the aircraft's state before allowing it to be armed - for example, 
that it has a good GPS fix.  This test will FAIL if the craft ever arms when some arming checks are disabled.

* Fail: Some of the arming checks were disabled when the craft was armed

Attitude Control
================

The autopilot reports both the craft's attitude and the attitude the craft believes it should be at.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if the vehicle's desired attitudes and achieved attitudes are 
not within threshold delta values for more than a threshold time.

* Fail: Desired attitude not achieved
* Warn: Desired attitude not achieved
* Warn: Vehicle attitude never set

Attitude Estimate Divergence
============================

A UAV often has several estimates of its attitude.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's attitude estimates diverge.

* Fail: This attitude estimate differs from the canonical craft attitude.
* Warn: This attitude estimate differs from the canonical craft attitude.

.. _analyzer_autopilot:

AutoPilot Health
================

Many autopilots are capable of monitoring their own performance.  This test will FAIL if problems are detected with the autopilot.

* Fail: Severe scheduler overruns

Battery
=======

Many autopilots are capable of monitoring their flight batteries. 

This test will FAIL if the battery level falls below the 
`battery failsafe <http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/failsafe-battery/>`_ 
threshold level, or if a battery failsafe event is received.

* Fail: Battery fell below failsafe threshold
* Fail: Battery failsafe event received
* Pass: Battery never below failsafe

Compass Offsets
===============

Compass calibration produces a set of parameters that specify expected compass discrepancies.  
This test will WARN or FAIL depending on the degree that these compass offset parameters exceed specified thresholds.

* Fail: Compass offsets in parameters are out of bounds
* Fail: Compass offset parameter set seen/set
* Warn: Compass offsets in parameters are out of bounds
* Warn: Compass offsets in parameters are zero
* Pass: Compass offsets in parameters look reasonable

Compass Vector Length
=====================

The strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field should be relatively constant and lie within certain thresholds.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if the compass vector length exceeds the respective threshold.  Possible causes include flying near large metal objects.

* Fail: Compass Vector Length above threshold
* Fail: Compass Vector Length below threshold
* Fail: Compass Vector Length delta exceeds threshold
* Warn: Compass Vector Length below threshold
* Warn: Compass Vector Length above threshold

Crash Test
==========

Crashes are detected both heuristically and by explicit log messages.  This test will FAIL if the vehicle appears to crash

* Fail: Vehicle evaluated itself as crashed
* Fail: Vehicle is past maximum allowed angle and running its motors
* Warn: Vehicle's attitude never updated
* Pass: Never crashed

Ever Armed
==========

Vehicles typically need to progress through a sequence of arming steps before they can move.  
This test will FAIL if the craft did not arm.

* Fail: The vehicle never armed
* Pass: The vehicle armed

Ever Flew
=========

Determining whether a vehicle has ever flown in a log is done heuristically based on things like motor speeds.  
This test will FAIL if the craft did not ever seem to fly.

As evidence the test provides information about the whether the vehicle armed
and whether it reaches the servo threshold required to take off.

* Fail: The vehicle never seemed to take off
* Pass: The vehicle appeared to fly

Good EKF
========

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has many built-in checks to ensure that it is functioning correctly.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if EKF variances exceed the respective thresholds, or FAIL if the EKF status flags indicate errors.

For EKF status flag fails, the evidence field provides information about the specific estimates that are incorrect.

* Fail: The EKF status report indicates a problem with the EKF
* Fail: [variance] exceeds fail threshold
* Warn: [variance] exceeds warn threshold
* Warn: [variance] was never updated
* Warn: EKF flags were never updated



.. note::

    In the list above [variance] is one of:  velocity, pos_horiz_variance, 
    pos_vert_variance, compass_variance, terrain_alt_variance.

GPS Fix
=======

The accuracy and precision of GPS messages can vary depending on many factors including weather, 
ionospheric disturbances and number of satellites visible.  This test will FAIL if the quality of the GPS information is poor.

The test compares the recorded number of satellites and HDOP (horizontal degree of precision) 
to threshold values and reports both values as "evidence".

* Fail: No 3D fix was ever acquired
* Pass: First 3D GPS Fix Acquired

Gyro Drift
==========

Gyroscopes sometimes start to register movement where there is none.  
This test will FAIL or WARN if the any gyroscope's average acceleration on any axis begins to drift.

* Fail: Gyroscope readings differ from first gyroscope
* Warn: Gyroscope readings differ from first gyroscope

Position Estimate Divergence
============================

Sensor Health
=============

A UAV can self-assess its sensors' health.  This test will FAIL if any sensor is detected as failed.

* Fail: The craft's assessment of its sensors indicate a problem

Truncated Log
=============

A log should not end while the vehicle appears to be moving under its own power.  
This test will FAIL if the vehicle still appears to be moving when the log ends.

* Fail: Log ended while craft still flying
* Pass: Log truncation not detected


.. note::

   There are several possible causes for a truncated log (including power failure due to brownout,
   running out of memory for the log file, or failure of the logging sub-system).

.. _analyzer_listing_vehicle_definition:

Vehicle Definition
==================

The vehicle type is normally automatically detected by dronekit-la from the log.  
Sometimes the log does not contain sufficient information to make this determination.  
This test will FAIL if the craft type is never defined.

* Fail: No information provided defined what type of vehicle was being analysed
* Pass: Vehicle was appropriately defined


.. note:: 
    
    Information about the vehicle type/frame allows a much deeper log analysis. This information
    is typically present in logs, but may be omitted. 
    
    If you get this error you should provide the information to the tool using the ``-m`` and ``-f`` flags as
    shown:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        ./dronekit-la <files> -m copter -f quad
        
        
.. tip::

    `Solo <https://3drobotics.com/solo-drone/>`_ tlogs do not include the frame and model information!
